This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_20/) explores the various remedial procedures for handling skewed data with extreme outliers for classification. Using a Logistic Regression model structure, methods applied in the analysis to address data distribution skewness and outlying points included the Box-Cox Transformation, Yeo-Johnson Transformation, Exponential Transformation, Inverse Hyperbolic Sine Transformation, Base-10 Logarithm Transformation, Natural Logarithm Transformation, Square Root Transformation, Outlier Winsorization Treatment and Outlier Spatial Sign Treatment. The resulting predictions derived from the candidate models applying various remedial procedures were evaluated in terms of their discrimination power using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) metric. The AUROC values were compared to that of the baseline model which made use of data without any form of data transformation and treatment.
